I'll say - the code is on the same level as my payment for it :)

How to Present This to Your Students
(Casually lean on the desk, gesture at the projected code, and deliver with a mix of irony and sincerity)

The Honest Introduction

"Ladies and gentlemen, behold—our ‘ MVP ’ (Minimally Viable Pedagogy)!"

"This code is like a free sample at a grocery store—technically edible, but don’t sue me if it’s missing nutritional labels."

"I wrote this pro bono on my own time, so it’s priced accordingly: free.99. Manage expectations like you would a Wikipedia article—useful, but verify before launching a satellite."

"No, there aren’t unit tests. Why? Because I’m a tired human, not ChatGPT-5. We’ll write those together next time."

we’re the open-source maintainers, and our test suite is ‘trust me bro’ for now."

The Legacy Pitch

"By the end, this’ll be our mess—er, masterpiece. Like a group project but without the one person who ghosts on Slack."

"And if it breaks? Perfect. Debugging is where the real learning happens. Just don’t tell my boss I said that."

(And if anyone complains? Smile and say: “PRs welcome.” 😉)
